# Unsupervised Learning Course
Implementation of some clustering algorithms and work on community detection louvain algorithm

## Description
HW - Implementation of various clustering algorithms: 
1. Data generation based on multivariate normal distributions.
2. Gaussian mixture model using expectation maximization (maximum likelihood estimation).
3. Fuzzy C-means, and [unsupervised optimal fuzzy clustering](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/192473/).
4. Agglomerative hierarchical clustering based on different distances.
5. Competitive learning
